This is a single family house designed by Japanese studio Kengo Kuma and Associates. We are the architects responsible for adapting, developing and the construction on its site in Spain.

The project, located in an olive field, pretends to fade with the landscape throughout itâ€™s geometry between two levels, using the actual local materials from the surroundings to integrate mimetically in the environment. A reflection about techniques and local solutions applied in a contemporary disruptive way. All together with a meticulous and delicate development throughout  all the house. The space fades between interior and exterior, the cover and the layout.

Location: Chiva

Area: 200 sqm

Year: 2017

Status: under construction
